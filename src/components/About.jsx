        About Me
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I am a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in
        building scalable and user-focused full-stack applications. I started
        my journey with a solid foundation in <span className="text-white font-medium">
        C++ and Data Structures</span>, which helped me develop strong
        problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Over time, I transitioned into <span className="text-white font-medium">
        web development</span>, gaining hands-on experience with the
        <span className="text-white font-medium"> MERN stack</span>. I enjoy
        creating responsive frontends, designing efficient backend APIs, and
        working on real-world projects that solve practical problems.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        My goal is to grow as a <span className="text-white font-medium">
        professional full-stack developer</span> and contribute to impactful
        software solutions while continuously improving my technical and
        communication skills.
